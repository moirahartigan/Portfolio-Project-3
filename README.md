## Future Features
+ I would like to add sound animation to the game to allow for sound effects to play on click correct flip of card and on completion of game. 
+ I would like to add a mute button to allow the user to control the sound effects.
+ I would like to add a high score leader board to the game to allow the user to add their name and record the moves and time.

# Technologies Used

## Languages Used
1. [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) - To create a basic site.

## Frameworks Libraries and Programmes Used
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) - used to host repository.
* [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/workspaces) - used to develop project and organise version control.
* [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/moirahartigan/Ms1-Schools-Out-Childcare/settings/pages) - used to deploy the site.

# Testing
## Validator Testing
At the completion or heavy editing of sections, I used the following to check my code for syntax errors:


### <em>HTML Validator</em>

 </p>
 
 The JavaScript code was run through Beautify Tools to not only beaufify the code but also to check for any syntax errors.
    
* All pages came back with no errors.
 

## Testing User Stories
* 
All user stories have been fullfilled from the original targets. The game functions are all working with no issues found.


## Problems Encountered

# Deployment
## Creating the App
This application will be deployed via [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/love-moiras-sandwiches/deploy/github)

* Ensure all code is correct and ready for deployment.
* Enter the following code to import the required dependencies to the requirements.txt file:
    * pip3 freeze > requirements.txt

* Heroku will use this file to import the dependencies that are required.
* Log into Heroku or sign up for a free account.
* If signing up, you will need to wait and accept an authentication email.
* Navigate to Dashboard.
* Click "New" and select "create new app" from the drop-down menu. This is found in the top right cornor of the window.
* Provide a unique name for your application and select your region.
* Click "Create App".

## Setting up the Heroku App 
* Navigate to "Settings" and scroll down to "build packs".
* Click "build packs" and then click both "python" and "node.js"(node.js is needed for the mock terminal.)
* Take note of the order and ensure that the python buildpack is above the node.js buildpack, You can click and drag the packs to re-arrange them.

This site was deployed through GitHub Pages using the following steps:
## Deployment through GitHub Pages
* Navigate to the "Deploy" section.
* Scroll down to "Deployment Method" and select "GitHub".
* Authorize the connection of Heroku to GitHub.
* Search for your GitHub repository name, and select the correct repository.
* For Deployment there are two options, Automatic Deployments or Manual.
* Automatic Deployment: This will prompt Heroku to re-build your app each time you push your code to GitHub.
* Manual Deployment: This will only prompt Heroku to build your app when you manually tell it to do so.
* Ensure the correct branch is selected "master/Main", and select a deployment method. For this project I chose Automatic Deployment.
