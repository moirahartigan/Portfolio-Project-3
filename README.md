## Future Features
+ I would like to add sound animation to the game to allow for sound effects to play when the user wins or looses the game and for background music during the game. 
+ I would like to add a mute button to allow the user to control the sound effects.

# Technologies Used

## Languages Used
1. [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) - To create a basic site.

## Frameworks Libraries and Programmes Used
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) - used to host repository.
* [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/workspaces) - used to develop project and organise version control.
* [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/moirahartigan/Ms1-Schools-Out-Childcare/settings/pages) - used to deploy the site.
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home)

# Testing
## Validator Testing
At the completion or heavy editing of sections, I used the following to check my code for syntax errors:


### <em>PEP8 Linter</em>

# Deployment
## Creating the App
This application will be deployed via [Heroku]()

* Ensure all code is correct and ready for deployment.
* Enter the following code to import the required dependencies to the requirements.txt file:
    * pip3 freeze > requirements.txt

* Heroku will use this file to import the dependencies that are required.
* Log into Heroku or sign up for a free account.
* If signing up, you will need to wait and accept an authentication email.
* Navigate to Dashboard.
* Click "New" and select "create new app" from the drop-down menu. This is found in the top right cornor of the window.
* Provide a unique name for your application and select your region.
* Click "Create App".

## Setting up the Heroku App 
* Navigate to "Settings" and scroll down to "build packs".
* Click "build packs" and then click both "python" and "node.js"(node.js is needed for the mock terminal.)
* Take note of the order and ensure that the python buildpack is above the node.js buildpack, You can click and drag the packs to re-arrange them.

This site was deployed through GitHub Pages using the following steps:
## Deployment through GitHub Pages
* Navigate to the "Deploy" section.
* Scroll down to "Deployment Method" and select "GitHub".
* Authorize the connection of Heroku to GitHub.
* Search for your GitHub repository name, and select the correct repository.
* For Deployment there are two options, Automatic Deployments or Manual.
* Automatic Deployment: This will prompt Heroku to re-build your app each time you push your code to GitHub.
* Manual Deployment: This will only prompt Heroku to build your app when you manually tell it to do so.
* Ensure the correct branch is selected "master/Main", and select a deployment method. For this project I chose Automatic Deployment.
